# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously in Local Deep Research. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**Please DO NOT open a public issue.** Instead, report vulnerabilities privately through one of these methods:

1. **[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/security/advisories/new)** (Preferred):
   - Click the link above or go to Security tab → Report a vulnerability
   - This creates a private discussion with maintainers

2. **Email**:
   - Send details to the maintainers listed in CODEOWNERS
   - Use "SECURITY:" prefix in subject line

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### Our Commitment

- We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We'll provide an assessment within 1 week
- We'll work on a fix prioritizing based on severity
- We'll credit you in the fix (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

We follow a coordinated disclosure process with best-effort target timelines:

| Severity | Target Fix Time | Public Disclosure |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Critical | 30 days         | After fix released |
| High     | 45 days         | After fix released |
| Medium   | 60 days         | After fix released |
| Low      | 90 days         | After fix released |

**Note**: This is a community-maintained project. Actual fix times may vary depending on complexity and maintainer availability. We do our best to address security issues promptly.

- **Coordination**: We work with reporters to coordinate disclosure timing
- **Credit**: Reporters are credited in release notes and security advisories (unless anonymity requested)
- **CVE Assignment**: For significant vulnerabilities, we will request CVE assignment through GitHub Security Advisories

## Security Considerations

This project processes user queries and search results. Key areas:

- **No sensitive data in commits** - We use strict whitelisting
- **API key handling** - Always use environment variables
- **Search data** - Queries are processed locally when possible
- **Dependencies** - Regularly updated via automated scanning

### Database Encryption

Local Deep Research uses **SQLCipher** (AES-256-CBC) for database encryption. Each user's database is encrypted with their login password as the key, derived via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 with 256,000 iterations and a per-user random salt. There is no separate password hash — authentication works by attempting to decrypt the database. API keys stored in the database are encrypted at rest.

### In-Memory Credentials

Like all applications that use secrets at runtime — including [password managers](https://www.ise.io/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/), browsers, and API clients — credentials are held in plain text in process memory during active sessions. This is an [industry-wide reality](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html) acknowledged by [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html), [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-security-securestring) (who deprecated `SecureString` for this reason), and the [pyca/cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/stable/limitations/) library.

**Why in-process encryption does not help:** If an attacker can read process memory, they can also read any decryption key stored in the same process. The password exists in Flask session storage, database connection managers, and thread-local storage throughout the application's lifetime — protecting only one copy (e.g., SQLCipher's internal buffers) does not meaningfully reduce exposure.

**What we do to mitigate:**
- Session-scoped credential lifetimes with automatic expiration
- Core dump exclusion via container security settings

Ideas for further improvements are always welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/issues).

### Memory Security (`cipher_memory_security`)

SQLCipher's `cipher_memory_security` pragma controls whether SQLCipher zeroes its internal buffers after use and calls `mlock()` to prevent memory pages from being swapped to disk.

**Default: OFF.** Since the same password is unprotected elsewhere in process memory (see above), locking only SQLCipher's internal buffers does not meaningfully reduce exposure.

To enable memory security (e.g., for compliance requirements):

```bash
# Environment variable
LDR_DB_CONFIG_CIPHER_MEMORY_SECURITY=ON
```

In Docker, `mlock()` requires the `IPC_LOCK` capability:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  local-deep-research:
    cap_add:
      - IPC_LOCK
    environment:
      - LDR_DB_CONFIG_CIPHER_MEMORY_SECURITY=ON
```

Or with `docker run`:

```bash
docker run --cap-add IPC_LOCK -e LDR_DB_CONFIG_CIPHER_MEMORY_SECURITY=ON ...
```

`IPC_LOCK` is a narrow Linux capability that only permits memory locking — it does not grant any other privileges.
